# Create quick connects<a name="quick-connects"></a>

Quick connects are a way for you to create a list of destinations for common transfers\. For example, you might create a quick connect for Tier 2 support\. If agents in Tier 1 support can't solve the issue, they will transfer the contact to Tier 2\. 

**How many quick connects can I create?** To view your quota of **Quick connects per instance**, open the Service Quotas console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/servicequotas/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)\.

## Types of quick connects<a name="quick-connect-types"></a>

The type of a quick connect specifies the destination\. You can specify one of the following destinations\.

### Phone number quick connect<a name="external-quick-connect-type"></a>

Contacts are transferred to a phone number \(such as an on\-call pager\)\. 

### User quick connect<a name="agent-quick-connect-type"></a>

Contacts are transferred to a specific user, such as an agent, as part of a flow\.

**Important**  
User and Queue quick connects only appear in the CCP when an agent goes to transfer a contact\. 

### Queue quick connect<a name="queue-quick-connect-type"></a>

Contacts are transferred to a queue as part of a flow\.

**Important**  
User and Queue quick connects only appear in the CCP when an agent goes to transfer a contact\.
