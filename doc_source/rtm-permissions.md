# Permissions required to view real\-time metrics reports<a name="rtm-permissions"></a>

To view real\-time metrics reports, you need to be assigned to a security profile that has either the **Access metrics \- Access** permission or the **Real\-time metrics \- Access** permission\. Note the following behavior when you assign these permissions:
+ When **Access metrics \- Access** is selected, the **Real\-time metrics**, **Historical metrics**, and **Agent activity audit** permissions are also automatically assigned\. 
+ When **Access metrics \- Access** is assigned, you have access to all real\-time and historical metrics reports\.

The following image shows the **Analytics and Optimization** section of the **Security profile permissions** page\. The **Access** option is selected for **Access metrics**, **Real\-time metrics**, **Historical metrics**, and **Agent activity audit**\.

If only **Real\-time metrics** is selected, you have access only to real\-time metrics and no other analytics pages or reports\. The following image shows the **Analytics and Optimization** section, with only **Real\-time metrics \- Access** selected\.
