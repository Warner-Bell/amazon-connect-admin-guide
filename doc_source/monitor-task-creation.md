# Monitor task creation<a name="monitor-task-creation"></a>

After your connection is established, if it stops working, in Amazon Connect disassociate the connection, and then re\-establish it\. If that doesn't solve the issue, do the following:

**Zendesk**

1. Go to the EventBridge console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/)\.

1. Check the status of the event source connection to see if it is active\.

**Salesforce**

1. Go to the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/appflow\)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow)\. 

1. Monitor the flow that was created for the account that was set up\.

The following image shows what a flow looks like in the Amazon AppFlow console for Salesforce\. It contains information about the status of the connection, and when it was last run\.

For both Zendesk and Salesforce, you can go to the EventBridge console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/) to see your connection state and see if it is active, pending, or deleted\. 

The following image shows an example EventBridge console\.
