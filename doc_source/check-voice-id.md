# Flow block: Check Voice ID<a name="check-voice-id"></a>

## Description<a name="check-voice-id-description"></a>

**Note**  
The [Set Voice ID](set-voice-id.md) block needs to be set in the flow before this one\. That block sends audio to [Amazon Connect Voice ID](voice-id.md) to verify the customer's identity, and returns a status\. 

The **Check Voice ID** block branches based on the results of the voice analysis and the status returned by Voice ID:
+ **Enrollment status**: 
  + **Enrolled**: The caller is enrolled in voice authentication\.
  + **Not enrolled**: The caller has not yet been enrolled in voice authentication\. When this status is returned, for example, you may want to directly route the call to an agent for enrollment\.
  + **Opted out**: The caller has opted out of voice authentication\.

  You are not charged for checking enrollment status\. 
+ **Voice authentication status**:
  + **Authenticated**: The caller's identity has been verified\. That is, the authentication score is greater than or equal to the threshold \(default threshold of 90 or your custom threshold\)\.
  + **Not authenticated**: The authentication score is lower than threshold that you configured\.
  + **Inconclusive**: Unable to analyze a caller's speech for authentication\. This is usually because Voice ID did not get the required 10 seconds to provide a result for authentication\. 
  + **Not enrolled**: The caller has not yet been enrolled in voice authentication\. When this status is returned, for example, you may want to directly route the call to an agent for enrollment\.
  + **Opted out**: The caller has opted out of voice authentication\.

  You are not charged if the result is **Inconclusive**, **Not enrolled** or **Opted out**\.
+ **Fraud detection status**: 
  + **High risk**: The risk score meets or exceeds the set threshold\.
  + **Low risk**: The risk score did not meet the set threshold\.
  + **Inconclusive**: Unable to analyze a caller's voice for detection of fraudsters in a watchlist\.

  You are not charged if the result is **Inconclusive**\.

**Note**  
For **Enrollment status** and **Voice authentication**, the [Customer ID](connect-attrib-list.md) system attribute needs to be set in [Set contact attributes](set-contact-attributes.md) block because they are acting on a specific customer\. You don't need to do this for **Fraud detection** because it's not acting on a specific customer but rather detecting whether the incoming caller matches a fraudster on your watchlist\. This means it's possible for a customer to be successfully authenticated and still have high fraud risk\.

## Properties<a name="check-voice-id-properties"></a>

This block doesn't have any properties that you set\. Rather, it creates branches for you to route contacts based on the result of the authentication threshold and voiceprint evaluation that [Set Voice ID](set-voice-id.md) returns\.

The following image shows the **Properties** page for the **Check voice ID** block when it's configured to check for Enrollment status\. Different status results are returned when it's configured for **Voice authentication** or **Fraud detection**\.
