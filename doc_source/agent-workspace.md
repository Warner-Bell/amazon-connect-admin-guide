# Customize the Amazon Connect Agent Workspace<a name="agent-workspace"></a>

This section explains how to customize the agent workspace and enable guided experiences\. 

Out\-of\-the\-box, the agent workspace integrates all of your agent facing capabilities on one page\. For example, when an agent accepts a call, chat, or task, they are given necessary information about the case and customer, plus real\-time recommendations\. 

You can customize the agent workspace by enabling guided experiences, for example, and customizing the look and feel of the View resources in the agent workspace\.

The following image shows the parts of the agent workspace\. 

1. The Contact Control Panel, which agents use to accept calls, chats, and tasks\.

1. Real\-time recommendations, powered by Amazon Connect Wisdom\.

1. The case ID, and other info on the **Cases** tab, powered by Amazon Connect Cases\.

1. Step\-by\-step guides\.

1. Customer information on the **Customer profile** tab, powered by Amazon Connect Customer Profiles\.
