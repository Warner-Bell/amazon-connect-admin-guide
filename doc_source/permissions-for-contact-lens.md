Following is a description of the permissions\.

**Contact search**  
This permission isn't specific to Contact Lens, but it is required so you can access the **Contact search** page, which is where you can search contacts so you can review the analyzed recording and transcript\. In addition, you can do fast, full\-text search on call transcripts, and search by sentiment score and non\-talk time\. 

**Search contacts by conversation characteristics**  
On the **Contact Search** page:  
+ For voice contacts, you can access additional filters that allow you to return results by sentiment score and non\-talk time\.
+ For chat contacts, you can access an additional filter to search for contacts by response time\. 
+ For both voice and chat, you can search conversations that fall into specific contact categories\. 
For more information, see [Search for sentiment score/shift](search-conversations.md#sentiment-search), [Search for non\-talk time](search-conversations.md#nontalk-time-search), and [Search a contact category](search-conversations.md#contact-category-search)\.  
The following image shows of the **Filters** section of the **Contact Search** page, and the **Filters** dropdown menu\. Filters with **CL** next to them are only available to users who have this security profile permission\.

**Search contacts by keywords**  
On the **Contact Search** page, you can access additional filters that allow you to search contacts by **Words or phrases**, such as "*thank you for your business*\." For more information, see [Search for words or phrases](search-conversations.md#keyword-search)\.

**Rules**  
This permission allows you to view, edit, or create rules for categorizing contacts\. For more information, see [Automatically categorize contacts based on uttered keywords and phrases](rules.md)\.

**Recorded conversations \(redacted\)**  
On the **Contact details** and **Contact search** pages for a contact, this permission allows you to listen to call recording files or view the chat transcript in which the sensitive data has been removed\. For more information, see [Example redacted file for a call](contact-lens-example-output-files.md#example-redacted-file)\.

**Recorded conversations \(unredacted\)**  
On the **Contact details** and **Contact search** pages, this permission manages access to unredacted content that contains sensitive data such as name and credit card information\. It manages access to the following unredacted content:   
+ Original, unredacted chat and speech transcripts analyzed by Contact Lens
+ Original, unredacted transcripts analyzed by Contact Lens
+ Original, unredacted audio recordings
You can access this content on the **Contact details** page for a contact\. For more information, see [Example original, analyzed file for a call](contact-lens-example-output-files.md#example-original-output-file)\.  
If you have permissions to both **Recorded conversations \(redacted\)** and **Recorded conversations \(unredacted\)**, note the following behavior:   
+ By default only redacted recordings and transcripts are made available on the **Contact details** and **Contact search** pages\.
+ When no redacted content exists for the contact, or when redacted content cannot be shown to the user, then unredacted content is displayed on the **Contact details** and **Contact search** pages\.
To access unredacted conversations, remove permissions to **Recorded conversations \(redacted\)**\. This leaves the user with only **Recorded conversations \(unredacted\)** permissions\.  
You cannot access both the redacted and unredacted version of a conversation at the same time\.
