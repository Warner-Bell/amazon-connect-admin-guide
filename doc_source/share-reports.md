# Share custom reports<a name="share-reports"></a>

You can only share reports that you create and save\. This means you need the following permissions in your security profile to share reports: **Access metrics \- Access** and **Saved reports \- Create**\. The following image shows the **Access metrics \- Access** permissions on the security profiles page\.
