If you have problems logging in to the CCP, contact your manager for help, or the IT Department for your organization\.

## Log out of the Amazon Connect CCP<a name="ccp-logout"></a>

**Important**  
Closing the CCP doesn't automatically sign out an agent\. Amazon Connect still tries to route contacts to them\. To change this behavior, a developer can customize CCP for your contact center\. For instructions, see [CCPv1: Log out agents automatically when they close their CCP](automatic-logout.md)\. 

1. At the top of the CCP, choose **Settings**\. 

1. Choose **Log out**\.
