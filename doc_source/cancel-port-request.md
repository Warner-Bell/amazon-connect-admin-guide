# Can I cancel a porting that is already scheduled?<a name="cancel-port-request"></a>

**Important**  
If you need to cancel or reschedule your porting, let us know immediately\.

Depending on the country of service, after a mutually agreed date and time has been provided it can be difficult to cancel\. 

Because of the coordination required between carriers, Amazon Connect support requires a minimum of 5 business days notice to cancel or reschedule a porting request, if the number has not already been ported\. If you need to cancel or reschedule your porting, let us know immediately\. 

You cannot cancel a port after it has been moved to the RespOrg \(Responsible Organization\)\. The port is complete\. For this situation, see [Revert to original carrier after porting](revert-porting-to-original-carrier.md)\. 

If a porting is successfully cancelled, timelines for the port schedule are reset and the carriers will need to identify another mutually agreed date and time\. This will impact the overall timeline for porting your numbers\. 

**Note**  
Please be advised that sometimes a porting request cannot be cancelled because of process automation, but Amazon Connect support will make every attempt possible to stop the request\.
