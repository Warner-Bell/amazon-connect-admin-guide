# Enable Identity Resolution for your Customer Profiles domain<a name="enable-identity-resolution"></a>

When you enable Identity Resolution you specify the following information:
+ When the Identity Resolution Job should run on a weekly basis\. By default, it runs Saturdays at 12AM UTC\.
+ The Amazon S3 bucket where the Identity Resolution Job should write the results of the automatic profile matching process\. If you don't have an S3 bucket, you'll have the option to create one during the enablement process\. 

  You can query the Amazon S3 bucket or use the [GetMatches](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_GetMatches.html) API to filter results based on [confidence scores](how-identity-resolution-works.md#confidence-score)\.

**Note**  
After you enable Identity Resolution you'll see the option to [create consolidation criteria](create-consolidation-criteria.md) for the optional auto\-merging process\.
