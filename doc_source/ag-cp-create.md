# Create a new customer profile in the agent workspace<a name="ag-cp-create"></a>

Let's say you're on a chat and there's no customer profile for the contact\. You can create a new customer profile for them\.

1. Choose **Create profile**\.   
![\[The Customer profile tab, the create profile option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/customer-profiles-no-profiles-found.png)

1. Choose **This is the current connected customer**\. This tells Amazon Connect to link the customer profile to the contact ID for the current customer\.

   If you don't select this check box, the profile isn't associated with the current contact\. This is useful when a contact is calling from someone else's number\.

   Enter information in the required boxes, and then choose **Save**\.  
![\[The create profile page, the check box for This is the current connected customer.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/customer-profiles-create-profile-detail.png)

1. You'll receive a verification page that the contact has been created\.
