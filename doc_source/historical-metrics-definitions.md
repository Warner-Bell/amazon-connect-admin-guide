# Historical metrics definitions<a name="historical-metrics-definitions"></a>

The following metrics are available to include in historical metrics reports in Amazon Connect\.

**Tip**  
Developers can use the [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) and [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) APIs to get a subset of the following historical metrics from the specified Amazon Connect instance\.

## Adherence<a name="adherence-historical"></a>

This metric is available only in AWS Regions where [Forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling](regions.md#optimization_region) is available\.

The percentage of time that an agent correctly follows their schedule\. This is measured by tracking if an agent is in an *Available* agent status when they should be in productive state\. This percentage is calculated as follows: 

Adherence % = \(\(Total Adherent Minutes\)/ Total Scheduled Adherence Minutes\)

An agent is considered adherent if the agent is in an *Available* status, when the shift activity is *Productive*, or if the agent is in *Non\-Productive* status \(for example, a custom status\), when the shift activity is Non\-Productive\. Otherwise the agent is considered non\-adherent\. This means that if a shift activity is named *Lunch* but marked as productive, the agent is considered adherent if they are in the *Available* agent status\.

In the [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) API, this metric is `AGENT_SCHEDULE_ADHERENCE`\.

Type: String

Min value: 0\.00%

Max value: 100\.00%

Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

**Note**  
Any time you change the schedule, Schedule Adherence is re\-calculated up to 30 days in the past from the current date \(not the date of the schedule\), if schedules are changed\.

## Adherent time<a name="adherent-time-historical"></a>

This metric is available only in AWS Regions where [Forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling](regions.md#optimization_region) is available\.

The total time an agent was in an *Available* status when their shift activity is productive or was is in non\-productive status when the shift activity is non\-productive\.

In the [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) API, this metric is `AGENT_ADHERENT_TIME`\.

Type: String

Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## After contact work time<a name="acw-historical"></a>

The total time that an agent spent doing ACW for a contact\. In some businesses, also known as Call Wrap Up time\.  

You specify the amount of time an agent has to do ACW in their [ agent configuration settings](configure-agents.md)\. When a conversation with a contact ends, the agent is automatically allocated to do ACW for the contact\. They stop doing ACW for a contact when they indicate they are ready for another contact in the CCP\.

In the [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) API, this metric is `AFTER_CONTACT_WORK_TIME`\.

Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)

Category: contact record\-driven metric

## Agent answer rate<a name="agent-answer-rate-historical"></a>

Percentage of contacts routed to an agent that were answered\.

Type: String \(hh:mm:ss\)

Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Agent first name<a name="agent-first-name-historical"></a>

The first name of the agent, as entered in their Amazon Connect user account\. This metric is available only when grouping by agent\.

Type: String 

Length: 1\-255

## Agent idle time<a name="agent-idle-time-historical"></a>

After the agent sets their status in the CCP to **Available**, this is the amount of time they weren't handling contacts \+ any time their contacts were in an Error state\. 

Agent idle time doesnâ€™t include the amount of time from when Amazon Connect starts routing the contact to the agent, to when agent picks up or declines the contact\.

Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)

Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Agent incoming connecting time<a name="htm-agent-incoming-connecting-time"></a>

The name of the agent, displayed as follows: **Agent last name**, **Agent first name**\. This metric is available only when grouping by agent\.

## Agent non\-response<a name="agent-non-response"></a>

Count of contacts routed to an agent but not answered by that agent, including contacts abandoned by the customer\. 

If a contact is not answered by a given agent, we attempt to route it to another agent to handle; the contact is not dropped\. Because a single contact can be missed multiple times \(including by the same agent\), it can be counted multiple times: once for each time it is routed to an agent but not answered\.

+ Type: Integer 
+ Category: contact record\-driven metric

## Customer hold time<a name="customer-hold-time-historical"></a>

Total time that customers spent on hold after being connected to an agent\. This includes time spent on a hold when being transferred, but does not include time spent in a queue\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: contact record\-driven metric

## Error status time<a name="error-status-time-historical"></a>

For a specific agent, the total time contacts were in an error status\. This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue\. 
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Maximum queued time<a name="maximum-queued-time-historical"></a>

The longest time that a contact spent waiting in the queue\. This includes all contacts added to the queue, even if they were not connected with an agent, such as abandoned contacts\.

In the [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) API, this metric is `QUEUED_TIME`\.

In the [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) API, this metric is `MAX_QUEUED_TIME`\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: contact record\-driven metric

## Non\-Productive Time<a name="npt-historical"></a>

Total time that agents spent in a [custom status](agent-custom.md)\. That is, their CCP status is other than **Available** or **Offline**\. 

This metric doesn't mean that the agent was spending their time unproductively\. 

**Tip**  
Agents can handle contacts while their CCP status is set to a custom status\. For example, agents can be **On contact** or doing **ACW** while their CCP is set to a custom status\. This means it's possible for agents to be counted as **On contact** and **NPT** at the same time\.   
For example, if an agent changes their status to a custom status, and then makes an outbound call, it would be counted as non\-productive time\.

This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue\.
+ Type: String \(*hh:mm:ss*\)
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Occupancy<a name="occupancy-historical"></a>

Percentage of time that agents were active on contacts\. This percentage is calculated as follows:

\(Agent on contact \(wall clock time\) / \(Agent on contact \(wall clock time\) \+ Agent idle time\)\) 

Where: 
+ \(Agent on contact \+ Agent idle time\) = total amount of agent time
+ So \(Agent on contact\)/\(total amount of agent time\) = percentage of time agents were active on contacts\.

**Important**  
**Occupancy** doesn't account for concurrency\. That is, an agent is considered 100% occupied for a given interval if they are handling at least one contact for that entire duration\.   
In the [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) API, this metric is `OCCUPANCY`\.  
In the [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) API, this metric is `AGENT_OCCUPANCY`\.
+ Type: String
+ Min value: 0\.00%
+ Max value: 100\.00%
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Online time<a name="online-time-historical"></a>

Total time that an agent spent with their CCP set to a status other than **Offline**\. This includes any time spent in a custom status\. This metric can't be grouped or filtered by queue, phone number, or channels\. 
+ Type: String
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Scheduled time<a name="scheduled-time-historical"></a>

This metric is available only in AWS Regions where [Forecasting, capacity planning, and scheduling](regions.md#optimization_region) is available\.

Total time an agent was scheduled \(either for productive or non\-productive time\) and *Adherence* for those shifts was set to `Yes`\.

In the [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) API, this metric is `AGENT_SCHEDULED_TIME`\.
+ Type: String \(\(hh:mm:ss\)
+ Category: Agent activity\-driven metric

## Service level *X*<a name="service-level-historical"></a>

Percentage of contacts removed from the queue between 0 and *X* after being added to it\. A contact is removed from a queue when the following occurs: an agent answers the contact, the customer abandons the contact, or the customer requests a call back\. 

For *X* you can choose from pre\-set times in seconds: 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 600\. This percentage is calculated as follows:

\(Contacts removed from queue in *X* seconds / Contacts queued\) \* 100

In the [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) and [GetMetricDataV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html) APIs, this metric is `SERVICE_LEVEL`\.
+ Type: String
+ Min value: 0\.00%
+ Max value: 100\.00%
+ Category: contact record\-driven metric

### Custom service levels<a name="custom-service-level-historical"></a>

You can also create custom service level metrics\. Choose from additional durations, such as minutes, hours, or days\.

Custom service levels are localized to the report where they are created\. For example, you create a report that has a custom service level of 75\. You leave the page and then create another report\. The custom service level 75 won't exist in the second report\. You'll need to create it again\. 

The maximum duration for a custom service level is 7 days\. That's because in Amazon Connect you can't have a contact that goes longer than 7 days\.

You can add up to 10 custom service levels per report\.
