# How supervisors view published schedules<a name="scheduling-view-schedule-supervisors"></a>

After a scheduler publishes a schedule, it's official\. Agents can now view their individual scheduling using their agent application\. Supervisors can also view their agents schedules using the Amazon Connect console\.

Supervisors with **Scheduling**, **Schedule manager \- Edit** permissions in their security profile can edit agent schedules\.

**Important**  
When a supervisor edits an agent schedule and publishes it, the change appears immediately to the agent\. They do not need to refresh their browser for the agent application to reflect the change\.

The following image shows a sample schedule for a supervisor's team\.

Managers and supervisors can sort or filter schedules based on the following criteria\.
+ **Sort** schedules based on the earliest shift start time\. For example, the agents who would login first to take customer contacts will show up on top\. The following example displays a manager or supervisor who searches for agents by first name, last name, or login ID with the string `sal`, sorted by their shift start times\.

+ **Filter** schedules based on agent names or agent IDs, Staffing Groups, or Supervisor names\.
