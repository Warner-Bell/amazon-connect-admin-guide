# How to get an Amazon Connect phone number in your current country<a name="get-connect-number"></a>

To place or receive calls in your Amazon Connect instance, you need to claim a DID or toll\-free phone number\. If you did not claim a phone number when you created your Amazon Connect instance, follow these steps to claim one now\.

**To claim a number for your contact center**

1. Log in to Amazon Connect at https://*instance name*\.my\.connect\.aws/\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **Channels**, **Phone numbers**\.

1. Choose **Claim a number**\. You can choose a toll\-free number or a Direct Inward Dialing \(DID\) number\. If you're in the US, you can specify the area code you want for your number, and only available numbers with that area code will be displayed\. When numbers are returned, choose one\.   
![\[The Claim phone number page, DID (Direct Inward Dialing) tab.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tutorial1-claim-number.png)
**Note**  
Use the [Amazon Connect service quotas increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-connect) for these situations:   
If you select a country or region, but no numbers display, you can request additional numbers for the country or region\. 
If you want to request a specific area code or prefix that you don't see listed, we'll try to accommodate your request\.

1. Enter a description for the number and, if required, attach it to a contact flow in **Flow / IVR**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

1. Repeat this process until you have claimed all your required phone numbers\.

There is a service quota for how many phone numbers you can have in each instance\. For the default service quota, see [Amazon Connect service quotas](amazon-connect-service-limits.md)\. If you reach your quota, but want a different phone number, you can release one of previously claimed numbers\. You cannot claim the same phone number after releasing it\. 

If you need more phone numbers, you can request a service quota increase using the [Amazon Connect service quota increase form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-connect)\.

## API instructions<a name="get-connect-number-programmatically"></a>

To claim a phone number programmatically: 

1. Use the [SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers.html) API to search for available phone numbers that you can claim to your Amazon Connect instance\.

1. Use [ClaimPhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html) API to claim the phone number\. 

   Claiming a number by using the [ClaimPhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html) API puts the number in one of the following three states: `CLAIMED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `FAILED`\.

1. Run the [DescribePhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePhoneNumber.html) API to determine the status of your number claiming process\. 
   + `CLAIMED` means the previous [ClaimPhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html) or [UpdatePhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html) operation succeeded\.
   + `IN_PROGRESS` means a [ClaimPhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html) or [UpdatePhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html) operation is still in progress and has not yet completed\. You can call [DescribePhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePhoneNumber.html) at a later time to verify if the previous operation has completed\.
   + `FAILED` indicates that the previous [ClaimPhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html) or [UpdatePhoneNumber](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html) operation has failed\. It will include a message indicating the failure reason\. A common reason for a failure may be that the `TargetArn` value you are claiming or updating a phone number to has reached its limit of total claimed numbers\. If you received a `FAILED` status from a `ClaimPhoneNumber` API call, you have one day to retry claiming the phone number before the number is released back to the inventory for other customers to claim\.

**Note**  
You will not be billed for the phone number during the 1\-day period if number claiming fails\.
