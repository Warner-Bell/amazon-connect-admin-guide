# Create an outbound campaign<a name="how-to-create-campaigns"></a>

Contact centers send outbound campaigns to customers for a variety of reasons, such as appointment reminders, telemarketing, subscription renewals, and debt collection\. By using Amazon Pinpoint Journeys and Amazon Connect, you can create outbound campaigns for voice, SMS, and email\.  

There are two ways you can create an outbound campaign:
+ Use Amazon Connect console and Amazon Pinpoint\. This topic provides instructions\.
+ Use the Amazon Connect Outbound Campaigns API\. For more information, see [Amazon Connect Outbound Campaigns API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect-outbound/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\. 
**Note**  
You can't update the name of the outbound queue by using the API\.
When you create a campaign by using the API: For users to be able to view or edit a campaign at a later date by using the Amazon Connect user interface, you must add the instance ID as a tag\.
