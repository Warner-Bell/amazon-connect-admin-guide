+ If your organization uses the Contact Control Panel \(CCPv1 or CCPv2\), Salesforce CTI, or a custom\-built agent desktop, agents access their schedule by entering **https://*instance name*/connect/agent\-app\-v2/scheduling** into their browser, logging into Amazon Connect, and then choosing the calendar icon\.
