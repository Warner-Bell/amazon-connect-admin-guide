# Search for recordings by contact ID<a name="search-recordings"></a>

To find a recording of a specific contact, you only need the contact ID\. You don't need to know the date range, agent, or any other information about the contact\. 

**Tip**  
We recommend using the contact ID to search for recordings\.  
Even though many call recordings for specific contact IDs may be named with the contact ID prefix itself \(for example, 123456\-aaaa\-bbbb\-3223\-2323234\.wav\), there is no guarantee that the contact IDs and name of the contact recording file always match\. By using **Contact ID** for your search on the **Contact search** page, you can find the correct recording by referring the audio file on the contact's record\.

**To search for recordings**

1. Log in to Amazon Connect with a user account that has [permissions to access recordings](assign-permssions-to-review-recordings.md)\.

1. In Amazon Connect choose **Analytics and optimization**, **Contact search**\. 

1. In the **Contact ID** box, enter the contact ID, and then choose **Search**\.

1. Conversations that were recorded have icons in the **Recording/Transcript** column\. The following image shows the play, download, and delete icons\. If you don't have the appropriate permissions, you won't see these icons\.
