# Security profile permissions for Customer Profiles<a name="assign-security-profile-customer-profile"></a>

Assign the following **Customer profiles** permissions as needed to the agent's security profile:
+ **View**: Enables agents to see the Customer profiles application\. They can:
  + View profiles that are autopopulated in the agent app\.
  + Search for profiles\.
  + View details stored in customer profiles \(for example, Name, Address\)\.
  + Associate contact records to profiles, as shown in the following image\.  
![\[The customer profiles tab in the agent workspace, the Associate button.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/customer-profiles-associate.png)
+ **Edit**: Enables agents to edit details in the customer profile \(for example, change address\)\. They inherit **View** permissions by default\.
+ **Create**: Enables agents to create and save a new profile\. They inherit **View** permissions by default, but don't inherit **Edit** permissions\.

For information about how add more permissions to an existing security profile, see [Update security profiles](update-security-profiles.md)\.

By default, the **Admin** security profile already has permissions to perform all Customer profiles activities\.
