+ All required fields must be filled in\.

## Customer name<a name="cm-customername"></a>

Each case that is created is connected to a customer profile from your Amazon Connect instance\. While viewing the case details page, an agent can click or tap the customer's name to open the associated Customer Profile in a different tab\. Or, the agent can choose **More \(\.\.\.\)** to copy the customer name or profile ID to the clipboard\. On new case templates, the customer name appears by default on the case details page\. You can rearrange this field on your case template, or even remove it entirely\.
