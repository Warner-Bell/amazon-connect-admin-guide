# Amazon Connect concepts<a name="connect-concepts"></a>

Amazon Connect enables you to create an **omnichannel contact center**: a contact center that provides a unified experience across multiple channels, such as voice, chat, and tasks\.
+ You use the same routing profiles, queues, flows, metrics, and reports for all channels\.
+ Managers monitor all channels from one dashboard\.
+ Agents handle all customers from just one interface\. If a customer interaction starts with chat and moves to voice, the agent handling the voice call has the complete chat transcript so context is preserved\. 

You can create highly personalized experiences for your customers using omnichannel communications, and separate the channels where needed\. For example, you can dynamically offer chat and/or voice contact based on such factors as customer preference, estimated wait times, and agent skill\. 

This section explains concepts that will help you set up your Amazon Connect contact center, whether you use one channel or more\.
