To enable call center managers to create outbound campaigns, assign the **outbound campaigns** permissions to their security profile\.

For information about how add more permissions to an existing security profile, see [Update security profiles](update-security-profiles.md)\.

By default, the **Admin** security profile already has permissions to perform all activities\.
