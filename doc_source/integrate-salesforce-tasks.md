# Set up application integration for Salesforce<a name="integrate-salesforce-tasks"></a>

If you integrate with Salesforce for event creation, Amazon Connect also uses Amazon AppFlow to put the data into EventBridge\. This is because of how Salesforce sends events through the Amazon AppFlow APIs\. To learn more about how Amazon Connect uses EventBridge and Amazon AppFlow resources to power Salesforce integrations, see this blog post: [ Building Salesforce integrations with Amazon EventBridge and Amazon AppFlow](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-salesforce-integrations-with-amazon-eventbridge/)\. 

**Note**  
If you use custom AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies, for a list of the required IAM permissions to set up Amazon Connect Tasks, see [Tasks page](security-iam-amazon-connect-permissions.md#tasks-page)\.

**To integrate Salesforce for task creation**

1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

1. On the instances page, choose the instance alias\. The instance alias is also your **instance name**, which appears in your Amazon Connect URL\. The following image shows the **Amazon Connect virtual contact center instances** page, with a box a box around the instance alias\.  
![\[The Amazon Connect virtual contact center instances page, the instance alias.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/instance.png)

1. Choose **Tasks**, and then choose **Add an application**\.  
![\[The tasks page, the Add an application button.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-add-an-application-button.png)

1. On the **Select application** page, choose **Salesforce**\. 

1. Review the application requirements that are listed on the **Select application** page\. 

   The following image shows the requirements for Salesforce\.  
![\[The select application page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-choose-an-app-salesforce.png)

   1. To verify that Salesforce is compatible with Amazon AppFlow, log in to Salesforce, for example, https://\[instance\_name\]\.my\.salesforce\.com\.
**Important**  
Verify that you have enabled **Change Data Capture** in Salesforce\. The following image shows an example **Change Data Capture** page in Salesforce where you select the Case entities:  

![\[The change data capture page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-verify-app-salesforce.png)

1. After you verify Salesforce requirements, on the **Select application** page, choose **Next**\.

1. On the **Establish connection** page, choose one of the following: 
   + **Use an existing connection**\. This allows you to reuse existing EventBridge resources that are linked to Amazon AppFlow flows that you may have created in your AWS account\.
   + **Create a new connection**: Enter the information required by the external application\.

     1. Enter your application instance URL\. This URL is used for deep\-linking into the tasks created in your external application\.

     1. Provide a friendly name for your connection, for example, **Salesforce \- Test instance**\. Later, when you [add rules](add-rules-task-creation.md), you'll refer to this friendly name\.

     1. Specify whether this is a production or sandbox environment\.  
![\[The establish connection page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-establish-connection.png)

1. Choose **Log in to Salesforce**\. 

1. In Salesforce, choose to allow access to Amazon Connect Embedded Login App \[Region\]\.   
![\[The salesforce login page, the allow access prompt.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-establish-connection-allow-access-salesforce.png)

1. After Amazon Connect has successfully connected with the Salesforce, go to Salesforce and verify that the refresh token policy for Amazon Connect Embedded Login App is set to **Refresh token is valid until revoked**\. This grants Amazon AppFlow access to pull data from your Salesforce account without re\-authenticating\.

1. On the **Establish connection** page, select the box shown in the following image, and choose **Next**\.   
![\[The Establish connection page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-establish-connection-successful.png)

1. On the **Review and integrate** page, check that the **Connection status** says **Connected**, and then choose **Complete integration**\.   
![\[The Review and integrate page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-establish-connection-review-and-integrate.png)

1. On the **Tasks** page, the new connection is listed\.  
![\[The Tasks page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-establish-connection-final.png)

You're done\! Next, add rules that tell Amazon Connect when to create a task and how to route it\. For instructions, see [Create rules that generate tasks for third\-party integrations](add-rules-task-creation.md)\.

## What to do when is a connection isn't successfully established<a name="fix-connection-not-established-salesforce"></a>

A connection might fail to be established for Salesforce if you didnâ€™t follow the instructions next to the check boxes to verify that it's compatible with Amazon AppFlow\.

A common error is not setting up the **Case** entity in the **Change Data Capture** settings to capture these events\. To fix:

1. Log in to Salesforce, go to the **Change Data Capture**, and select the Case entity\.  
![\[The change data capture page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-verify-app-salesforce.png)

1. Open the Amazon AppFlow console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/appflow\)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appflow) to select the flow that was just created, and then choose **Activate flow**\.  
![\[The flow in the Amazon AppFlow console.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/tasks-integration-activate-flow.png)

Alternatively, you might need to delete the Amazon AppFlow Salesforce connection and flow, and start again\.
