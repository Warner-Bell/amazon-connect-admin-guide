1. Open the Amazon Connect console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/connect/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/)\.

   + **Use an existing connection**\. This allows you to reuse existing EventBridge resources you may have created in your AWS account\.
   + **Create a new connection**: Enter the information required by the external application\.

     1. Enter your application instance URL\. This URL is used for deep\-linking into the tasks created in your external application\.

You're done\! Next, add rules that tell Amazon Connect when to create a task and how to route it\. For instructions, see [Create rules that generate tasks for third\-party integrations](add-rules-task-creation.md)\.

## What to do when is a connection isn't successfully established<a name="fix-connection-not-established-zendesk"></a>

A connection might fail to create a task if you do not correctly select the **Support ticket** event type when setting up the connection in Zendesk, after being prompted to do so in the flow\. To fix this, log in to Zendesk, and update that setting, as shown in the following image\. 

![\[The Amazon Web Services page, the support ticket option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/zendesk-support-ticket.png)

There is also another case where you may not have selected the correct AWS Region that the Amazon Connect instance is in, when setting up EventBridge\. To fix:

1. Go to the EventBridge console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/events/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/events/)\.

1. Disconnect your EventBridge connection\.

1. In the Amazon Connect console, restart the flow\.
