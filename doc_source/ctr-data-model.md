# Contact records data model<a name="ctr-data-model"></a>

This article describes the data model for Amazon Connect contact records\. Contact records capture the events associated with a contact in your contact center\. Real\-time and historical metrics are based on the data captured in the contact records\.

## Important things to know<a name="important-things-to-know-ctr-data-model"></a>
+ We continually release new features that result in the addition of new fields to the contact records data model\. Any changes we make to the data model are backward compatible\. When you develop applications, we recommend that you build them to ignore the addition of new fields in the contact records data model\. This will help ensure your applications are resilient\.
+ Amazon Connect delivers contact records at least once\. Contact records may be delivered again for multiple reasons, such as new information arriving after initial delivery\. For example, when you use [update\-contact\-attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/connect/update-contact-attributes.html) to update a contact record, Amazon Connect delivers a new contact record\. This contact record is available for 24 months from the time the associated contact was initiated\.

  If you're building a system that consumes contact record export streams, be sure to include logic that checks for duplicate contact records for a contact\. Use the **LastUpdateTimestamp** property to determine if a copy contains new data than previous copies\. Then use the **ContactId** property for deduplication\. 
+ Every action taken on a unique contact generates an event\. These events appear as a field or an attribute on the contact record\. If the number of actions for a contact exceeds a threshold, such as an internal storage limit, then any actions that follow will not appear on that contact record\.
+ For the contact record retention period and maximum size of the attributes section of a contact record, see [Amazon Connect feature specifications](feature-limits.md)\.
+ For information about when a contact record is created \(and thus can be exported or used for data reporting\), see [Events in the contact record](about-contact-states.md#ctr-events)\.
+ For a list of all contact attributes, including telephony call and case attributes, see [List of available contact attributes and their JSONPath reference](connect-attrib-list.md)\.

**ContactId**  
The ID of the contact\.  
Type: String

**DisconnectTimestamp**  
The date and time that the customer endpoint disconnected from Amazon Connect, in UTC time\.  
Type: String \(*yyyy*\-*mm*\-*dd*T*hh*:*mm*:*ss*Z\)

**DisconnectReason**  
Indicates how the contact was terminated\. This data is currently available in the Amazon Connect contact record stream and **Contact details** page\.  
The disconnect reason may not be accurate when there are agent or customer connectivity issues\. For example, if the agent is having connectivity issues, the customer might not be able to hear them \("Are you there?"\) and hang up\. This would be recorded as `CUSTOMER_DISCONNECT` and not reflect the connectivity issue\.  
Type: String  
Voice contacts can have the following disconnect reasons:  
+ `CUSTOMER_DISCONNECT`: Customer disconnected first\.
+ `AGENT_DISCONNECT`: Agent disconnected when the contact was still on the call\.
+ `THIRD_PARTY_DISCONNECT`: In a third\-party call, after the agent has left, the third\-party disconnected the call while the contact was still on the call\.
+ `TELECOM_PROBLEM`: Disconnected due to an issue with connecting the call from the carrier, network congestion, network error, etc\.
+ `BARGED`: Supervisor disconnected the agent from the call\.
+ `CONTACT_FLOW_DISCONNECT`: Call was disconnected in a flow\.
+ `OTHER`: This includes any reason not explicitly covered by the previous codes\. For example, the contact was disconnected by an API\.
Chats can have the following disconnect reasons:  
+ `AGENT_DISCONNECT`: Agent explicitly disconnects or rejects a chat\.
+ `CUSTOMER_DISCONNECT`: Customer explicitly disconnects\.
+ `OTHER`: Used only for error states such as message transport issues\.
For many contacts, such as contacts ended by flows or APIs, there will not be any disconnect reason\. In the contact record it will appear as `null`\.  
Tasks can have the following disconnect reasons:  
+ `AGENT_DISCONNECT`: Agent marked the task as complete\.
+ `EXPIRED`: Task expired automatically because it was not assigned or completed within 7 days\.
+ `CONTACT_FLOW_DISCONNECT`: Task was disconnected or completed by a flow\.
+ `API`: The [StopContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StopContact.html) API was called to end the task\.
+ `OTHER`: This includes any reason not explicitly covered by the previous codes\.

**InitialContactId**  
The identifier of the initial contact\.  
Type: String  
Length: 1\-256

**InitiationMethod**  
Indicates how the contact was initiated\.  
Valid values:  
+  `INBOUND`: The customer initiated voice \(phone\) contact with your contact center\. 
+  `OUTBOUND`: An agent initiated voice \(phone\) contact with the customer, by using the CCP to call their number\. This initiation method calls the [StartOutboundVoiceContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartOutboundVoiceContact.html) API\.
+  `TRANSFER`: The customer was transferred by an agent to another agent or to a queue, using quick connects in the CCP\. This results in a new CTR being created\.
+  `CALLBACK`: The customer was contacted as part of a callback flow\. 

  For more information about the InitiationMethod in this scenario, see [About queued callbacks in metrics](about-queued-callbacks.md)\. 
+  `API`: The contact was initiated with Amazon Connect by API\. This could be an outbound contact you created and queued to an agent, using the [StartOutboundVoiceContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartOutboundVoiceContact.html) API, or it could be a live chat that was initiated by the customer with your contact center, where you called the [StartChatConnect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartChatContact.html) API\.
+  `QUEUE_TRANSFER`: While the customer was in one queue \(listening to Customer queue flow\), they were transferred into another queue using a flow block\.
+  `MONITOR`: A supervisor initiated monitor on an agent\. The supervisor can silently monitor the agent and customer, or barge the conversation\.
+  `DISCONNECT`: When a [Set disconnect flow](set-disconnect-flow.md) block is triggered, it specifies which flow to run after a disconnect event during a contact\. 

  A disconnect event is when:
  + A call, chat, or task is disconnected\.
  + A call is disconnected by a customer, agent, third party, supervisor, flow, telecom problem, API, or any other reason\.
  + A task is disconnected as a result of a flow action\.
  + A task expires\. The task is automatically disconnected if it is not completed in 7 days\. 

  If a new contact is created while running a disconnect flow, then the initiation method for that new contact is DISCONNECT\.

## How to identify abandoned contacts<a name="abandoned-contact"></a>

An abandoned contact refers to a contact that was disconnected by the customer while in queue\. This means that they weren't connected to an agent\. 

The contact record for an abandoned contact has a **Queue**, and an **Enqueue Timestamp** because it was enqueued\. It won’t have a **ConnectedToAgentTimestamp**, or any of the other fields that populate only after the contact has been connected to an agent\.
