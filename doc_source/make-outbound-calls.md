# How to use the CCP to make outbound calls<a name="make-outbound-calls"></a>

Before you can make an outbound call, your contact center must be set up to allow agents to make calls\. For more information, see [Step 3: Set telephony](amazon-connect-instances.md#get-started-telephony) in [Create an Amazon Connect instance](amazon-connect-instances.md)\.

For information about the caller ID that's displayed when you make an outbound call, see [Set up outbound caller ID](queues-callerid.md)\.

**Note**  
**IT administrators**: For a list of countries available for outbound calls based on the Region of your instance, see [Amazon Connect pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/)\. If a country is not available in your dropdown menu, open a ticket to add it to your allow list\. For more information, see [Countries you can call by default](country-code-allow-list.md)\.
