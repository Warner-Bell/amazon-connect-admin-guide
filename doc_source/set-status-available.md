# Set your status to "Available" in the CCP<a name="set-status-available"></a>

When an agent is ready to handle calls or chats, they need to set their status in the CCP to **Available**\. This tells Amazon Connect they are ready to handle contacts\.

Amazon Connect uses information in the agent's [routing profile](routing-profiles.md) to determine which contacts to route to them\.

For more information about agent statuses, see [About agent status](metrics-agent-status.md)\. For information about how Amazon Connect counts the Available status in the real\-time metrics report, see [Available](real-time-metrics-definitions.md#available-real-time)\.
