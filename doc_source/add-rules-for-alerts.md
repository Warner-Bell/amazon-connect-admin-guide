# Alert supervisors in real\-time based on keywords and phrases<a name="add-rules-for-alerts"></a>

After you [enable real\-time analytics](enable-analytics.md) in your flow, you can add rules that automatically alert supervisors when a customer experience issue occurs\. This feature is not available for chat contacts\.

For example, Contact Lens can automatically send an alert when certain keywords or phrases are uttered during the conversation, or when it detects other criteria\. The supervisor sees the alert on the real\-time metrics dashboard\. From there, supervisors can listen in to the live call, and provide guidance to the agent over chat to help them resolve the issue faster\.

The following image shows an example of what a supervisor would see on the real\-time metrics report when they get an alert\. In this case, Contact Lens has detected an angry customer situation\.

When the supervisor listens in to a live call, Contact Lens provides them with a real\-time transcript and customer sentiment trend that helps them understand the situation and assess the appropriate action\. The transcript also eliminates the need for customers to repeat themselves if the call is transferred to another agent\. 

The following image shows a sample real\-time transcript\.

## Add rules for real\-time alerts<a name="add-category-rules-real-time"></a>

1. Log in to Amazon Connect with a user account that is assigned the **CallCenterManager** security profile, or that is enabled for **Rules** permissions\.

1. On the navigation menu, choose **Analytics and optimization**, **Rules**\. 

1. Select **Create a rule**, **Contact Lens**\. 

1. Assign a name to the rule\.

1. Under **When**, use the dropdown list to choose **real\-time analysis**\.

1. Choose **Add condition**, and then choose the type of match: 
   + **Exact Match**: Finds only the exact words or phrases\.
   + **Pattern Match**: Finds matches that may be less than 100 percent exact\. You can also specify the distance between words\. For example, you might look for contacts where the word "credit" was mentioned, but you do not want to see any mention of the words "credit card\." You can define a pattern matching category to look for the word "credit" that is not within a one\-word distance of the word "card\." 
**Tip**  
Semantic Match isn't available for real\-time analysis\.

1. Enter the words or phrases, separated by a comma, that you want to highlight\. Real\-time rules only support any keywords or phrases that **were mentioned**\.   
![\[A words and phrases rule.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-add-alert-rules-1.png)

1. Choose **Add**\. Each word or phrase separated by a comma gets its own line\.  
![\[A words and phrases rule with multiple phrases, each on it's own line.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-add-alert-rules-2.png)

   The logic that Contact Lens uses to read these words or phrases is: \(Talk OR to OR your OR manager\) OR \(this OR is OR not OR helpful\) OR \(speak OR to OR your OR supervisor\), etc\.

1. To add more words or phrases, choose **Add group of words or phrases**\. In the following image, the first group of words or phrases are what the agent might utter\. The second group is what the customer might utter\.

   1. In this first card, Content Lens reads each line as an OR\. For example: \(Hello\) OR \(thank OR you OR for OR calling OR Example OR Corp\) OR \(we OR value OR your OR business\)\.

   1. The two cards are connected with an AND\. This means, one of the rows in the first card needs to be uttered AND then one of the phrases in the second card needs to be uttered\.

   The logic that Contact Lens uses to read the two cards of words or phrases is \(card 1\) AND \(card 2\)\.

1. Choose **Add condition** to apply the rules to:
   + Specific queues
   + When contact attributes have certain values
   + When sentiment scores have certain values

   For example, the following image shows a rule that applies when an agent is working the BasicQueue or Billing and Payments queues, the customer is for auto insurance, and the agent is located in Seattle\.  
![\[A words and phrases rule with multiple conditions.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-add-category-rules-3.png)

1. When done, choose **Next**\. 

1. In the **Assign contact category** box, add a name for the category\. For example, **Compliant** or **Not\_Compliant**\.

1. Choose **Next**, then choose **Save and publish**\.
