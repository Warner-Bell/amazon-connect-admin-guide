# Amazon Connect Cases<a name="cases"></a>

Amazon Connect Cases enables your customer service organization to track, collaborate, and resolve customer cases\.

A *case* represents a customer's issue\. It is created to record the customer's issue, the steps and interactions taken to resolve the customer's issue, and the outcome\.

Without doing any integration work, you can enable Cases for your contact center\. You can set up cases to be created when contacts come in, and collect information from the customer to display on the case\. Alternatively, agents can manually create cases\. When an agent accepts a contact, they have context about an issue and can immediately start solving it\. You can create tasks to track and route follow up steps to resolve the case\. 

The following image shows an example case as it appears in the agent application\.
