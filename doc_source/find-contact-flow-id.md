# Find the flow ID<a name="find-contact-flow-id"></a>

The flow ID is the flow you want to use for inbound Apple Messages for Business messages\. Flows define the experiences for your customer when they begin a new chat\.

You can either reuse an existing flow that youâ€™re already using for voice or chat contacts, or create a new one specifically for Apple Messages for Business contacts\. For instructions about creating a new inbound flow, see [Create an inbound flow](create-contact-flow.md#create-inbound-contact-flow)\. 

For more information about flows, see [Create Amazon Connect Flows](connect-contact-flows.md)\.
