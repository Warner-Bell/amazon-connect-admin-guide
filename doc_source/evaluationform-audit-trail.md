An form is in one of the following states:
+ **Active**\. A published version of the form that is available to evaluators\.
+ **Draft**\. An inactive, locked version of the form\. A draft is unlocked only when you are working on it\.
+ **Locked**\. An evaluation form is locked when you activate or publish it\. Even after you deactivate the form, it stays locked, and becomes a historical version of the form\. However, you can activate the historical version to save it as new version\.
