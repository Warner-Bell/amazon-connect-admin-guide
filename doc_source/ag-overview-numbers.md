After you create an Amazon Connect instance, you can claim a phone number to use for your contact center\. You can use this phone number to place a test call in to your contact center to confirm that it is working correctly\. You can also use it in your production environment\.
+ For pricing information about claimed phone number costs, see [Amazon Connect pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/)\. 
+ For a list of the telephony capabilities that Amazon Connect provides, see the [Amazon Connect Telecoms Country Coverage Guide](https://d1v2gagwb6hfe1.cloudfront.net/Amazon_Connect_Telecoms_Coverage.pdf)\. 

If you want to keep a phone number you already have, you can port the phone number and use it with Amazon Connect\. After a phone number is ported to Amazon Connect, it appears in the list of available phone numbers for you to assign to flows\.
