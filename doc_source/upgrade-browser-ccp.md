# My CCP URL ends with /ccp\#<a name="upgrade-browser-ccp"></a>

Upgrading to the latest CCP is easy\. If you want, you can try out the latest CCP and then at a later date make the switch\. Here's what you do:

1. **Try it out**: Change the URL in your browser from **/ccp\#** to **/ccp\-v2**\. The latest CCP appears automatically\. If you want, change it back to /ccp\# to return to the earlier CCP\. 

1. **Upgrade**: Change the URL in your browser from **/ccp\#** to **/ccp\-v2**\. Bookmark the URL\. 

1. If you access the CCP through the Amazon Connect console by choosing the phone icon on the top right of a page, you will be re\-directed according to the automatic upgrade date sent by email\. Please reach out to your Amazon Solution Architect if your request is more urgent\.   
![\[The Amazon Connect user interface, phone icon in top right corner.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/upgradeccp-phone-icon.png)

## Verify your network settings<a name="upgrade-verify-network-settings"></a>

We highly recommend setting up your network to use [Option 1 \(recommended\): Replace Amazon EC2 and CloudFront IP range requirements with a domain allow list](ccp-networking.md#option1)\. 

Using this option helps Amazon Connect Support to quickly troubleshoot any issues you have\. Specifically, using **\*\.telemetry\.connect\.\{region\}\.amazonaws\.com** passes more metrics to our Support team to help with troubleshooting\. 

## Update your SAML URL to ccp\-v2<a name="update-saml-url"></a>

Change `destination=/connect/ccp` to `destination=/connect/ccp-v2`\.

For more information, see [Use a destination in your relay state URL](configure-saml.md#destination-relay)
