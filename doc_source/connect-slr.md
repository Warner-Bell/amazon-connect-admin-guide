# Use service\-linked roles for Amazon Connect<a name="connect-slr"></a>

## What are service\-linked roles \(SLR\) and why are they important?<a name="what-is-slr"></a>

Amazon Connect uses AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) [service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role)\. A service\-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to an Amazon Connect instance\. 

Service\-linked roles are predefined by Amazon Connect and include [all the permissions](#slr-permissions) that Amazon Connect requires to call other AWS services on your behalf\.

You need to enable service\-linked roles so you can use new features in Amazon Connect, such as tagging support, the new user interface in **User management** and **Routing profiles**, and queues with CloudTrail support\.

For information about other services that support service\-linked roles, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) and look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Service\-Linked Role** column\. Choose a **Yes** with a link to view the service\-linked role documentation for that service\.
