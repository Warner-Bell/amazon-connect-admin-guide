+ **Non\-Productive**: At work activities that agents do that are not counted as productive work, such as breaks and team meetings\.
+ **Time off**: Absent from work\. Their status in the agent application is **Offline**\.

You can create multiple shift activities to include as part of your staff shifts\.
