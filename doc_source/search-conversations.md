# Search conversations analyzed by Contact Lens<a name="search-conversations"></a>

You can search the analyzed and transcribed recordings based on: 
+ Speaker \(agent or customer\)
+ Keywords
+ Sentiment score
+ Non\-talk time \(for calls only\)
+ Response time \(for chats only\)

In addition, you can search conversations that are in specific contact categories \(that is, the conversation has been categorized based on uttered keywords and phrases\)\.

These criteria are described in the following sections\.

**Important**  
When a Contact Lens is enabled on a contact, after a call or chat ends **and** the agent completes After Contact Work \(ACW\), Contact Lens analyzes \(and for calls, transcribes\) the recording of the customer\-agent conversation\. The agent must choose **Close contact** first\.  
Chat transcripts are indexed for search when Contact Lens is enabled; they are not indexed for search if Contact Lens is not enabled\.

## Required permissions for searching conversations<a name="security-profile-permissions-for-search"></a>

Before you can search conversations, you need the following permissions in your security profile\. They allow you to do the type of search you want\. 
+ **Contact search**\. This is required so you can get to the Contact Search page\.
+ **Search contacts by conversation characteristics**\. This includes non\-talk time, sentiment score, and contact category\.
+ **Search contacts by keywords**

For more information, see [Security profile permissions for Contact Lens](permissions-for-contact-lens.md)\.

## Search for words or phrases<a name="keyword-search"></a>

For keyword search, Contact Lens uses the `standard` analyzer in Amazon OpenSearch Service\. This analyzer is not case sensitive\. For example, if you enter *thank you for your business 2 CANCELLED Flights*, the search looks for:

 \[thank, you, for, your, business, 2, cancelled, flights\]

If you enter *"thank you for your business", two, "CANCELLED Flights"*, the search looks for:

 \[thank you for your business, two, cancelled flights\]

**To search conversations for words or phrases**

1. In Amazon Connect, log in with a user account that is assigned the **CallCenterManager** security profile, or that is enabled for the **Search contacts by keywords** permission\.

1. Choose **Analytics and optimization**, **Contact search**\.

1. In the **Filter** section, specify the time period that you want to search, and specify the channel\.
**Tip**

![\[The contact search page, the filters section, the add filter dropdown menu, the Words or phrases option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-search-words-phrases.png)

1. In the **Used by** section, choose whose part of the conversation you want to search\. Note the following:
   + **System** applies to chat, where the participant may be a Lex bot or prompt\.
   + To search for words or phrases that are used by all participants, select **Agent**, **Customer**, **System**\.
   + If no boxes are selected, it means search for words or phrases used by any of the participants\.

1. In the **Logic** section, choose from the following options:
   + Choose **Match any** to return contacts that have any of the words present in the transcripts\.

     For example, the following query means match \(hello OR cancellation OR "example airline"\)\. And, because no **Used by** boxes are selected, it means "find contacts where any of these words were used by any of the participants\."  
![\[The Words or phrases dialog box, the Match any option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/match-any.png)
   + Choose **Match all** to return contacts that have all of the words present in the transcripts\. 

     For example, the following query means match \("thank you for your business" AND cancellation AND "example airline"\)\. And, because all the participant boxes are selected, it means "find contacts where all of these words and phrases were used by all of the participants\."  
![\[The Words or phrases dialog box, the Match all option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/match-all.png)

1. In the **Words or phrases** section, enter the words to search, separated by commas\. If you enter a phrase, surround it with quotation marks\.

   You can enter up to 128 characters\.

## Search for sentiment score or evaluate sentiment shift<a name="sentiment-search"></a>

With Contact Lens, you can search conversations for sentiment scores or sentiment shifts on a scale of \-5 \(most negative\) to \+5 \(most positive\)\. This enables you to identify patterns and factors for why calls go well or poorly\.

![\[The contact search page, the sentiment score filter.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-sentiment-score-shift.png)

For example, suppose you want to identify and investigate all the contacts where the customer sentiment ended negatively\. You might search for all contacts where the sentiment score is **<=** \(less than or equal to\) \-1\. 

For more information, see [Investigate sentiment scores during contacts](sentiment-scores.md)\.

**To search for sentiment scores or evaluate sentiment shift**

1. In Amazon Connect, log in with a user account that is assigned the **CallCenterManager** security profile, or that is enabled for the **Search contacts by conversation characteristics** permission\.

1. On the **Contact search** page, specify whether you want the sentiment score for words or phrases spoken by the customer or agent\.

1. In **Type of score analysis**, specify what type of scores to return:
   + **Sentiment score**: This returns the average score for the customer or agent's portion of the conversation\.

     In addition to searching for sentiment scores when the agent or customer are on the contact, you can filter the search by when the customer is: 
     + **With agent on the chat**
     + **Without agent on the chat**: This is the time the customer is chatting with a bot, prompts, and time in queue\.   
![\[The sentiment score filter, the participant dropdown menu, the customer without agent on the chat option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-search-sentiment-participant.png)
   + **Sentiment shift**: Identify where the customer or agent's sentiment changed during the contact\.

     For example, the following images shows an example of searching for contacts where the customer's sentiment score begins at less than or equal to \-1 and ends at greater than or equal to \+1\. In addition, the customer is on a chat with the agent present\.  
![\[The sentiment score filter, the sentiment shift option.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/contact-lens-search-sentiment-score.png)

## Search for non\-talk time<a name="nontalk-time-search"></a>

To help you identify which calls to investigate, you can search for non\-talk time\. For example, you might want to find all calls where the non\-talk time is greater than 20%, and then investigate them\. 

Non\-talk time includes hold time and any silence where both participants aren't talking for longer than three seconds\. This duration can't be customized\.

Use the drop\-down arrow to specify whether to search conversations for the duration or percentage of non\-talk time\. These options are shown in the following image\. 

 For information about how to use this metric, see [Investigate non\-talk time during calls](non-talk-time.md)\.

![\[The non-talk time filter, the duration and percentage options.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/non-talk-time.png)

## Search by response time for chat conversations<a name="response-time-search"></a>

You can search by the:
+ Average response time of the agent or customer during the chat
+ Maximum response time of the agent or customer during the chat

You specify whether the duration is less or greater than or equal to a specific time\. For information about how to use this metric, see [Investigate response time during chats](response-time.md)\.

For the supported minimum and maximum response times, see [Amazon Connect Rules feature specifications](feature-limits.md#rules-feature-specs)\.

The following image shows a search for contacts where the agent's average response time was greater than or equal to 1 minute\. 

![\[The response time filter.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/response-time.png)

## Search a contact category<a name="contact-category-search"></a>

1. On the **Contact search** page, choose **Add filter**, **Contact category**\.

1. In the **Contact categories** box, use the dropdown box to list all the current categories that are available for you to search\. Or, if you start typing, the input is used to match existing categories and to filter those that don't match\.
   + **Match any**: Searches for contacts that match any of the selected categories\.
   + **Match all**: Searches for contacts that match all of the selected categories\.

   The following image shows a dropdown menu with all the current categories listed\.
