# Amazon Connect and interface VPC endpoints \(AWS PrivateLink\)<a name="vpc-interface-endpoints"></a>

You can establish a private connection between your VPC and a subset of endpoints in Amazon Connect by creating an interface VPC endpoint\. Following are the supported endpoints:
+ Amazon AppIntegrations
+ Customer Profiles
+ Outbound campaigns
+ Voice ID
+ Wisdom

The core Amazon Connect service does not support AWS PrivateLink or VPC endpoints\.

Interface endpoints are powered by [AWS PrivateLink](http://aws.amazon.com/privatelink), a technology that enables you to privately access Amazon Connect APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection\. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with the Amazon Connect APIs that integrate with AWS PrivateLink\.

For more information, see the [AWS PrivateLink Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/)\.

## Creating an interface VPC endpoint for Amazon Connect<a name="vpc-endpoint-create"></a>

You can create an interface endpoint using either the Amazon VPC console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For more information, see [Create an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html) in the *AWS PrivateLink Guide*\.

Amazon Connect supports the following service names:
+ com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.app\-integrations
+ com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.cases
+ com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.profile
+ com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.connect\-campaigns
+ com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.voiceid
+ com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.wisdom

If you enable private DNS for an interface endpoint, you can make API requests to Amazon Connect using the default DNS name for the Region\. For example, voiceid\.us\-east\-1\.amazonaws\.com\. For more information, see [DNS hostnames](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-aws-services.html#interface-endpoint-dns-hostnames) in the *AWS PrivateLink Guide*\.

## Creating a VPC endpoint policy<a name="vpc-endpoint-policy"></a>

You can attach an endpoint policy to your VPC endpoint that controls access\. The policy specifies the following information:
+ The principal that can perform actions\.
+ The actions that can be performed\.
+ The resources on which actions can be performed\.

For more information, see [Control access to services using endpoint policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the *AWS PrivateLink Guide*\.

### Example: VPC endpoint policy<a name="example-vpc-interface-endpoints"></a>

The following VPC endpoint policy grants access to the listed Amazon Connect Voice ID actions for all principals on all resources\. 

```
{
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
                "voiceid:CreateDomain",
                "voiceid:EvaluateSession",
                "voiceid:ListSpeakers"
            ],
            "Resource":"*",
            "Principal":"*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Following is another example\. In this one, the VPC endpoint policy grants access to the listed outbound campaigns actions for all principals on all resources\. 

```
{
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
                 "connect-campaigns:CreateCampaign",
                "connect-campaigns:DeleteCampaign",
                "connect-campaigns:ListCampaigns"
            ],
            "Resource":"*",
            "Principal":"*"
        }
    ]
}
```
