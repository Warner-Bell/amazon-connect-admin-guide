# Real\-time contact analysis segment streams data model<a name="real-time-contact-analysis-segment-streams-data-model"></a>

Real\-time contact analysis segment streams are generated in JSON\. Event JSON blobs are published to the associated stream for every contact that has real\-time contact analysis enabled\. The following types of events can be published for a real\-time contact analysis session:
+ STARTED events—Each real\-time contact analysis session publishes one STARTED event at the beginning of the session\.
+ SEGMENTS events—Each real\-time contact analysis session may publish zero or more SEGMENTS events during the session\. These events contain a list of segments with analyzed information\. The list of segments may include "`Utterance`," "`Transcript`," or "`Categories`" segments\.
+ COMPLETED or FAILED events—Each real\-time contact analysis session publishes one COMPLETED or FAILED event at the end of the session\.
