# Time off management<a name="scheduling-time-off"></a>

Amazon Connect time off management capabilities enable customers to manage agent time off requests that comply with pre\-configured regional labor and business rules\. Administrators or managers with the correct security profile permissions will be able to configure the various time off settings\. The system will automatically approve or reject requests depending on the configured time off rules and the daily maximum allowed time off hours\.

Supervisors or managers with permissions will have the ability to view agent time off requests and can override automatically approved or rejected time off\.
