**Create a time off request**

1. Supervisors or managers can go to the **Published schedule calendar** view, choose the floating icon on the bottom left and create a time off request\. The request drawer opens on the right\.  
![\[The Published schedule calendar tab, the request time off section.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/create-time-off-to.png)

1. Select **Staff** and the time off **Type**\. To select a time off range, you can either select **All day** or select specific start and end date times\. Select **Override time off rules** if you wish to override the system and allow time off while dismissing group allowance and other rules specified in Staff, Staffing Group or Shift profile rules\. Enter a **Reason** and choose **Request**\.

1. The request will enter a *pending* state to allow the system to analyze existing rules \(even thought rules checks are overridden\) and will display a list of any rule failures\.

1. The agent will see the pending request in their schedule UI and will receive an in\-app notification next to the **Request** icon which displays as an inbox icon at the top right above the metrics view\. This allows the agent to view the request details under the **Time off** tab\.

1. After the rules validation completes, the time off request status of **Approved** or **Rejected** will be displayed in both the agent and supervisor views\.
