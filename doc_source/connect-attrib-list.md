# List of available contact attributes and their JSONPath reference<a name="connect-attrib-list"></a>

The following tables describe the contact attributes available in Amazon Connect\.

The JSONPath reference for each attribute is provided so you can [create dynamic text strings](create-dynamic-text-strings.md)\. 

## System attributes<a name="attribs-system-table"></a>

These are predefined attributes in Amazon Connect\. You can reference system attributes, but you cannot create them\. 

Not all blocks in a flow support using System attributes\. For example, you cannot use a System attribute to store customer input\. Instead, use a [ user\-defined attribute](#user-defined-attributes) to store the data input by a customer\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Customer number | The customer's phone number\. When used in an outbound whisper flow, this is the number that the agents dialed to reach the customer\. When used in inbound flows, this is the number from which the customer placed the call\. This attribute is included in contact records\. When used in a Lambda function, it's included in the input object under CustomerEndpoint\.  | System | $\.CustomerEndpoint\.Address | 
| Customer ID | The customer's identification number\.  | System | $\.CustomerId | 
| Dialed number | The number the customer dialed to call your contact center\. This attribute is included in contact records\. When used in a Lambda function, it's included in the input object under SystemEndpoint\. | System | $\.SystemEndpoint\.Address | 
| Customer callback number | The number that Amazon Connect uses to call back the customer\. This number can be the one used for a queued callback, or when an agent is dialing from the CCP\. Transfer to callback queue functionality, or for an agent dialing from the CCP\. The default value is the number that the customer used to call your contact center\. However, it can be overwritten with the **Set callback number** block\.  This attribute is not included in contact records, and it's not accessible in Lambda input\. However, you can copy the attribute to a user\-defined attribute with the Set contact attribute block, which is included in contact records\. You can also pass this attribute as a Lambda input parameter in an Invoke AWS Lambda function block, which is not included in contact records\.  | System | not applicable | 
| Stored customer input | An attribute created from the most recent invocation of a **Store customer input** block\. The attribute values created from the most recent Store customer input block invocation\. This attribute is not included in contact records, and is not accessible in Lambda input\.

## Lambda contact attributes<a name="attribs-lambda-table"></a>

Lambda attributes are returned as key\-value pairs from the most recent invocation of an **Invoke AWS Lambda function** block\. External attributes are overwritten with each invocation of the Lambda function\.

To reference external attributes in JSONPath, use:
+ `$.External.attributeName`

where `AttributeName` is the attribute name, or the key of the key\-value pair returned from the function\. 

For example, if the function returns a contact ID, reference the attribute with ` $.External.ContactId`\. When referencing a contact ID returned from Amazon Connect, the JSONPath is `$.ContactId`\. 

**Note**  
Note the inclusion of `.External` in the JSONPath reference when the attribute is external to Amazon Connect\. Make sure to match the case for attribute names returned from external sources\.

For more information about using attributes in Lambda functions, see [Invoke AWS Lambda functions](connect-lambda-functions.md)\.

These attributes are not included in contact records, not passed to the next Lambda invocation, and not passed to the CCP for screenpop information\. However, they can be passed as Lambda function inputs on an **Invoke AWS Lambda function** block, or copied to user\-defined attributes using the **Set contact attributes** block\. When used in **Set contact attributes** blocks, the attributes that are copied are included in contact records, and can be used in the CCP\.

## User\-defined attributes<a name="user-defined-attributes"></a>

For all other attributes Amazon Connect defines the key and value\. For user\-defined attributes, however, you provide a name for the key and the value\.

Use user\-defined attributes in situations where you want to store values in a contact flow, and then refer to those values later\. For example, if you integrate Amazon Connect and a CRM or other system, you might want to get input from the customer such as their member number\. Then you can use that member number retrieve information about the member from the CRM, and/or use the member number throughout the flow, etc\.


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Any name you choose | A user\-defined attribute has two parts: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-attrib-list.html)  | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.*name\_of\_your\_destination\_key* | 

To create user\-defined attributes, use the [Set contact attributes](set-contact-attributes.md) block\. 

## Apple Messages for Business attributes<a name="apple-business-chat-attributes"></a>

Use the following contact attributes to route Apple Business Chat customers\. For example, if you have different lines of business using Apple Business Chat, you can branch to different flows based on the AppleBusinessChatGroup contact attribute\. Or, if you want to route Apple Business Chat messages differently from other chat messages, you can branch based on MessagingPlatform\. 


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSON | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  MessagingPlatform  |  The messaging platform from where the customer request originated\.  Exact value: **AppleBusinessChat**  | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.MessagingPlatform | 
|  AppleBusinessChatCustomerId  |  The customer’s opaque ID provided by Apple\. This remains constant for the AppleID and a business\. You can use this to identify if the message is from a new customer or a returning customer\.  | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.AppleBusinessChatCustomerId | 
|  AppleBusinessChatIntent  |  You can define the intent or purpose of the chat\. This parameter is included in a URL that initiates a chat session in Messages when a customer chooses the **Business Chat** button\.  | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.AppleBusinessChatIntent | 
|  AppleBusinessChatGroup  |  You define the group which designates the department or individuals best qualified to handle the customer’s particular question or problem\. This parameter is included in a URL that initiates a chat session in Messages when a customer chooses the **Business Chat** button\.   | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.AppleBusinessChatGroup | 
|  AppleBusinessChatLocale  |  Defines the language and AWS Region preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface\. It consists of a language identifier \(ISO 639\-1\) and a Region identifier \(ISO 3166\)\. For example, **en\_US**\.   | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.AppleBusinessChatLocale | 

## Customer Profiles attributes<a name="customer-profiles-attributes"></a>

Use the following contact attributes to autopopulate customer profiles in the agent app using the value of your choosing\. 


| Attribute | Description | Type | JSONPath Reference | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| profileSearchKey | A user\-defined attribute that has two parts: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-attrib-list.html)  | User\-defined | $\.Attributes\.*name\_of\_your\_destination\_key* | 

## Outbound campaign attributes<a name="campaign-attributes"></a>

You can use data in Amazon Pinpoint [segments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/segments-building.html) list to customize experiences in Amazon Connect flows\. To reference data in a segment list, use **Attributes\_*ColumnName***\. For more information, see [Adding personalized content to message templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/message-templates-personalizing.html)\.

**Note**  
Do not use **$\.**Attributes to reference these attributes\.
