1. On the **Select data source** page, choose which external application you want to get customer profiles data from\.

1. On the **Establish connection** page, choose one of the following:

1. On the **Integration options** page, choose which source objects you want to ingest and select their object type\. 

   Object types store your ingested data\. They also define how objects from your integrations are mapped to profiles when they are ingested\. Customer Profiles provides default object type templates you can use that define how attributes in your source objects are mapped to the standard objects in Customer Profiles\. You can also use the object mappings that youâ€™ve created from the [PutProfileObjectType](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_PutProfileObjectType.html)\. When adding or creating the Salesforce integration for the user created data mapping, you need to specify the specific data mapping, otherwise it will choose the Salesforce default data mapping for object type\. You can create your data mapping and use it when setting up a featured data connector\.

1. On the **Review and integrate** page, check that the **Connection status** says **Connected**, and then choose **Create integration**\.
