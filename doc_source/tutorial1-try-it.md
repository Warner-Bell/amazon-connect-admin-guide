You're ready to try out the Amazon Lex bot, routing, and flow\. The first step is to tell Amazon Connect which flow you want to test\.

1. On the navigation menu, go to the **Dashboard** and choose **Test chat**\.

1. Choose **Test Settings**\.

1. In the customer pane on the right, choose **End chat** to close the chat window\.

1. In the test CCP, choose **Close contact** to end the After Contact Work \(ACW\)\.

## Test a custom voice experience<a name="tutorial1-try-it-voice"></a>



1. If the test chat window is still open, choose **End chat** to close it\. Then you can try the voice experience\.

1. Call your phone number\.

1. When prompted, say *I'm having trouble accessing the internet*\. You should hear the message that you're being transferred to the NetworkIssue queue\.
**Tip**  
After you're transferred, you'll hear this message:   
*Thank you for calling\. Your call is very important to us and will be answered in the order it was received\.*  
This message is generated by a [default flow](contact-flow-default.md) named [Default customer queue](default-customer-queue.md)\.

1. Switch to the test CCP and accept the incoming call\.

1. After you accept the call, but before you're connected to the customer, you'll hear an inbound whisper stating what queue the contact is in, for example, NetworkIssue\. This helps you know what the customer is calling about\.

   The inbound whisper is generated by a [default flow](contact-flow-default.md) named [Default agent whisper](default-agent-whisper.md)\.

1. When done, end the call\.

1. In the CCP, choose **Clear contact** to end After Contact Work \(ACW\)\.

**Congratulations\!** You built and tested an omnichannel IT Help Desk that leverages Amazon Lex and offers customers both chat and voice\. 

**Tip**  
If you don't want to keep the phone number that you claimed for testing, you can release it back to inventory\. For instructions, see [Release a phone number from Amazon Connect back to inventory](release-phone-number.md)\.
