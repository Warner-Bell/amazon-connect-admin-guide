# Login/Logout reports<a name="login-logout-reports"></a>

The Login/Logout report displays the login and logout information for the users in your contact center \(for example, agents, managers, and administrators\)\. For each user session, the login and logout times are displayed as a row in the report\. You can use the report to determine the time users were logged in to Amazon Connect\. The report also displays the amount of time for each session that user was logged in to Amazon Connect\.

**Important**  
By default, when an agent closes their CCP window, they are not logged out\. Unless you have [customized your CCP for automatic logout](automatic-logout.md), agents must choose the **Logout** button\. Until they choose the **Logout** button, the Login/Logout report shows them as logged in\.

## Login/Logout report limit: 10,000 rows<a name="login-logout-considerations"></a>
+ If you try to generate a Login/Logout report that has more than 10,000 rows, it won't complete\.
+ The Login/Logout report page displays only 10,000\. 
+ If you schedule a Login/Logout report that contains more than 10,000 rows, the report will fail\. In addition, no report output will be saved to your S3 bucket, and you cannot view the report\.
+ If you have a contact center with a lot of users, and your reports fail to complete, you can specify a shorter time range to reduce the size of the report generated, or apply filters to the report, such as routing profile and agent hierarchy\. You can then use other filters to capture all of the login/logout data for your instance\.

## Required permissions to access the Login/Logout report<a name="loginlogout-report-permissions"></a>

Before you can generate a Login/Logout report, you need the following permissions assigned to your security profile: **Login/Logout report \- View**\.

![\[The metrics and quality section of the security profile permissions page.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/login-logout-report-permissions.png)

By default, the Amazon Connect **Admin** security profile has these permissions\.

For information about how add more permissions to an existing security profile, see [Update security profiles](update-security-profiles.md)\.

## Generate a Login/Logout report<a name="loginlogout-report-generate"></a>

A Login/Logout report includes only login or logout actions by your users that occurred during the specified time range\.
+  If user logged in during the time range and did not log out, the report shows a login time but not a logout time\.
+ If the user logged in before the start of the time range, and then logged out during the time range, the report shows both the login and logout times even though the login occurred before the start of the time range\. This is so you can view the duration of the user session associated with the most recent logout\.

## Schedule a Login/Logout report<a name="loginlogout-report-schedule"></a>

To generate a report with the same settings on a regular basis, you can schedule the report to run daily or on specific days of the week\. Note that *scheduled* Login/Logout reports work differently than Login/Logout reports you [generate](#loginlogout-report-generate) from the user interface for a specified time range\.

### Important things to know<a name="important-loginlogout-report-schedule"></a>
+ When you schedule a report, it is automatically published to your organization\. Anyone with appropriate permissions can view the report\. Users with all permissions for Login/Logout reports can also edit, schedule, or delete the report\.
+ For scheduled Login/Logout reports, the trailing window value is always the last 24 hours\.
+ A scheduled report always runs at 12AM on the day you select, in the time zone that you choose\. 

  For example, if you select Wednesday, the report runs at midnight Wednesday and does not include any data for Wednesday\.
+ Scheduled reports are saved as CSV files in your Amazon S3 bucket\. The default time zone is UTC\. To have your report run at 12AM in your local time, choose your time zone instead\. 
+ To email a scheduled report to a list of co\-workers, you need to generate the email manually using your messaging system\. Amazon Connect doesn’t provide an option to email the scheduled report automatically\.
