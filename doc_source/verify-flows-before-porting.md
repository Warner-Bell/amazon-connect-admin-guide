# How to verify flows before numbers are ported<a name="verify-flows-before-porting"></a>

We recommend that you test your call flows before the mutually agreed date and time of porting\. If you would like to test your call flows, we recommend that you claim a direct inward dial \(DID\) or toll\-free phone number available within Amazon Connect and assign it to the call flow for testing\. 

When you are done testing, you can release the number from your instance so you will no longer be charged for it\. For instructions, see [Release a phone number from Amazon Connect back to inventory](release-phone-number.md)\.

Until you release the number, you are charged the daily rate associated with claiming a phone number and the per minute rate for telephony minutes used\. For more information see the standard pricing for [Amazon Connect service usage and associated telephony rates](http://aws.amazon.com/connect/pricing/)\.
